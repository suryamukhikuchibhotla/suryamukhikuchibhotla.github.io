Hey there! I'm Suryamukhi, a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. 

My research centers on the automatic extraction of key information from natural language text and effective knowledge representation. I focus on identifying entities and the relationships between them, which supports applications in content summarization, semantic content organization, and personalized content recommendation. Through these efforts, my work aims to enhance the accessibility and interpretability of complex information, enabling more efficient information retrieval and user-centered insights.
